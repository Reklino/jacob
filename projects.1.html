				Our goal with the CSC Portfoio Site was to create a place that designers, sales representatives, and clients could all go for specification on digital products and see examples. We wanted a categorized list of ad types and a searchable database of examples.

				This was my first project at Halifax, so I was a bit timid to push back on some of the suggestions for how this site should look and feel, but in the end I was able to have some fun with it. I built the site using Drupal, because I was new enough to web development, but wanted the customizability that Drupal had to offer. I was also told to choose from a 'well known' cms, and felt like I would learn the most going with Drupal.
