				Our goal with the CSC Portfoio Site was to create a place that designers, sales representatives, and clients could all go for specification on digital products and see examples. We wanted a categorized list of ad types and a searchable database of examples. <strong>This was my first large project, and I learned a lot about the thin line that seperates web sites from web applications.</strong>

				Since this was my first project as web dev at Halifax, I was a bit timid to push back on some of the suggestions for how this site should look and feel, but in the end I was able to have some fun with it. I built the site using Drupal, because I was new enough to web development, but wanted the customizability that Drupal had to offer. I was also told to choose from a 'well known' cms, and felt like I would learn the most going with Drupal.

				I chose Roboto as the primary font because it matched the <strong>informative</strong> feel I wanted to go for with this site. The colors were based off of the 'Creative Services Center' logo and the 'Halifax Media Group' logo (both which existed before I worked here). <strong>The most difficult thing about this project was attempting to make various bosses/co-workers in the company happy and create a unified vision of what the site should be.</strong>
