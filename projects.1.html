				Our goal with the CSC Portfoio Site was to create a place that designers, sales representatives, and clients could all go for specification on digital products and see examples. We wanted a categorized list of ad types and a searchable database of examples.

				This was my first project at Halifax, so I was a bit timid to push back on some of the suggestions for how this site should look. If I were building this again today, I can tell you it would look a good deal different. I built the site using Drupal, because I was new enough to web development, but wanted the customizability that drupal had to offer.
