			<p>Whilst developing an angular application, I came across the need for resizable sections similar to the ones used in code editor sites like Codepen and Plunker. I searched around for solutions, but didn't like any that I found. The solutions I did find used javascript logic based on a specific layout, and therefore had strict use cases.

			<blockquote>My goal with Angular Resizable is to provide a resize module that is layout agnostic.</blockquote>
			<p>
			I developed a few prototypes on codepen which were well recieved, and published a github repo and npm package. Since then, I've had the pleasure of seeing it used in a variety of other developers projects.
