			<p>Whilst developing an angular application that uses side-by-side panels for editing content, I came across the need for <strong>resizable sections</strong> similar to the ones used in code editor sites like Codepen and Plunker. I searched around for solutions, but didn't like any that I found. The solutions I did find used javascript logic tailored to a specific layout, and therefore had strict use cases.
			</p>
			<blockquote>My goal with Angular Resizable is to provide a resize module that is layout agnostic.</blockquote>

			I developed a few prototypes on codepen, and published a github repo and npm package. Since then, I've had the pleasure of seeing it grow and be used in a variety of other developers projects. Open source is awesome :D
