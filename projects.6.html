				Strings was a project I took on to teach myself about designing and deploying icon fonts and/or svg sprites. Plus, I really couldn't find a good free linear icon set that had every icon I needed. The icons were designed on a 20px grid in illustrator.

			<blockquote>Making scaleable vector icons pixel perfect turned out to be a complicated process.</blockquote>
			<p>
				I learned a ton about icon fonts in this process, especially the challenges that come with designing pixel perfect icons in a vector format. In the end, I resolved an optimal workflow for designing, testing, and deploying the icons as a font or svg sprite set.

				You can find the project source on github, which includes the illustrator file in case anyone had the urge to add to the existing icons.
