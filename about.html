			After graduating from the University of Alabama with a BFA in Graphic Design in 2012 I got a job working for Halifax Media Group doing Graphic Design. I got an opportunity to do web development for them in 2013. Since then, I have built web applications, created rich media ad types, designed splash pages, constructed HTML emails, trained fellow co-workers, and done anything else my swiss army knife of a position required.

		<p>
			I just recently received a promotion to Digital Product Specialist &amp; Frontend Dev with the company that bought Halifax Media Group (Gatehouse) in 2015 where I will continue to do what I do, but on a larger scale.

			Outside of work, I enjoy stout beers, coffee, Adventure Time, video games, and sometimes all four at once. The only "sport" I'm any good at is Ping Pong, but I also enjoy disc golf, tennis, kayaking, and really anything where I can run around outside.
