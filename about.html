		<h3>Who am I?</h3>
		<p class="smaller">
			Hi there! My name is Jacob, and I'm a coffee drinking, Adventure Time watching nerd who likes making things. I am currently referring to myself as a 'frontend developer', because it sounds better than 'unicorn', but I love the entire process of web development and design. My traditional design roots stem from my education at The University of Alabama, but I've always been passionate about interactive mediums, and frontend development is the perfect fit. People who meet me describe me as bearded, weird, and honest.
