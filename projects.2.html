				HMGGO was intended to be a portal for sales staff across the company to access content quickly and easily. All I was asked to do was make an attractive responsive splash page that would excite and inspire sales reps. <strong>I was given full creative control including branding, design, and copy.</strong> I had three days to come up with something, so I only had time to do a couple of different concepts but both were well recieved.

				I paired Raleway with Open Sans for the fonts (Overused... I know), fontawesome for the icons, and I based the colors on the halifax logo with the added bright green from my logo.
