				As a part of a company wide branding campaign, I developed a splash page for the digital ads for the purpose of showcasing the community, culture, and people associated with the publication. Each property needed their own custom version of the landing page, so it was important that everything be modular.

				The layout and interaction was inspired by an awesome codrops concept, and I worked it in with our branding concept. I also tested the ineraction concept on some of my fellow co-workers to make sure it didn't go over anyone's head. Some people had a hard time figuring out that there were two different views to the page, so I added a delayed transition on page load that makes it clear. It was crucial that the landing page be functional all the way back to IE8 and be tablet friendly, so I modernizr for detection and added fallbacks that keep it functional in IE8+.
