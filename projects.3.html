				As a part of a company wide branding campaign, I developed a splash page for the digital ads for the purpose of <strong>showcasing the community, culture, and people associated with the publication</strong>. Each property needed their own custom version of the landing page, so it was important that everything be modular.
			</p>
			<p>
				The layout and interaction was inspired by an awesome codrops concept, and I worked it in with our existing branding concept and made it our own. I also tested the ineraction concept on some of my fellow co-workers to make sure it didn't go over anyone's head. Some people had a hard time figuring out that there were two different views to the page, so I added a delayed transition on page load that makes it clear. It was crucial that the landing page be functional all the way back to IE8 and be tablet friendly, so I used modernizr for detection and added fallbacks that keep it functional in IE8+.

				This was one of the few opportunities that arise where I had some serious creative control, so <strong>I wanted to have some fun</strong>. That goal was definitely accomplished.
