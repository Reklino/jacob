			<h5>Conception</h5>
			<p>
				First things first, I have an idea and sketch it out on paper that I then show to other people to make sure I'm not crazier than I thought.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="col-6">
			<h5>Design</h5>
			<p>
				I either design in Photoshop, Illustrator, or straight in the editor depending on the scenario and my familiarity with the style.
			</p>

			<h5>CLI</h5>
			<p>
				I use gulp for compilation of my SASS, minification/validation of my js, and inlining my svg sprites. I use browerSync to set up live reloading of my page during developlment.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="col-6">
			<h5>Styles</h5>
			<p>
				I write my CSS in SASS (SCSS) and compile it using libSASS and autoprefixer. If the project won't be able to support flexbox, I use Susy for SASS to manage my grid.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="col-6">
			<h5>Interactivity</h5>
			<p>
				If the project is complex enough to need a javascript framework, I generally lean towards AngularJS, but I'm looking for a reason to learn React and Ember.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="col-6">
			<h5>Backend</h5>
			<p>
				I currently use Laravel for my backend on projects, but I am hoping to try the MEAN stack for my next big project.
