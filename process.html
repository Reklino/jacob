			<h4>Conception</h4>
			<p>
				I like sketching out ideas on paper before actually putting in any work. I'll usually just do a few really bad sketches with pen and markers and go from there.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="col-6">
			<h4>Design</h4>
			<p>
				I either design in Photoshop, Illustrator, or (more typically) straight in the editor depending on the scenario and style of the project.
			</p>
		</div>
	</div>

		<div class="col-6">
			<h4>CLI</h4>
			<p>
				I use gulp for compilation of my SASS, minification/validation of my js, polyfills for ES6, and inlining my svg sprites. I use browerSync to set up live reloading of my page during developlment.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="col-6">
			<h4>Styles</h4>
			<p>
				I write my CSS in SASS (SCSS) and compile it using libSASS and autoprefixer. If the project won't be able to support flexbox, I use Susy for SASS to manage my grid. I am in the process of exploring the use of javascript for styles in place of CSS.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="col-6">
			<h4>Interactivity</h4>
			<p>
				If the project is complex enough to need a javascript framework, I generally lean towards AngularJS, but I'm looking for a reason to learn React and Ember. I have no loyalty to a specific framework, but instead just want to use the best tool for each individual job.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="col-6">
			<h4>Backend</h4>
			<p>
				I currently use Laravel + MySQL for my backend on projects, but I am hoping to try a node.js + mongodb stack on my next big project.
